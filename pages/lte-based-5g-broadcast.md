# 5G Broadcast - Relevant Specifications

## About ETSI TS 103 720 - 5G Broadcast System for linear TV and radio services

5G-MAG maintains the ETSI TS 103 720 specification, which introduces the 5G Broadcast System along with its associated features.
LTE-based 5G Broadcast is a profile of existing 3GPP specifications that addresses all requirements of a 5G Broadcast System. 
Several functions and reference points are defined. Receiver categories are defined that address implementation profiles 
to deploy, among others, linear television and radio services.

### Updates towards ETSI TS 103 720 v1.3.1
5G-MAG is now conducting the updates towards the new version of the specification.
5G-MAG kicked off in 2024 the new work item to update the specification according to 3GPP Release 18 and extends it to also cover Release 19.

The additions, discussed and agreed among members (see [**Kanban - ETSI TS 103 720**](https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/projects/32), include:
* Extensions in 3GPP Rel-18 to address additional use cases and scenarios;
* Identified bugs or at least clarification questions from implementors of ETSI TS 103 720, in particular by 5G-MAG;
* New requirements identified by 5G-MAG;
* Extensions to DVB-I to support 5G Broadcast Based on these considerations.
* Band support for receivers including Band 108 (UHF);
* 5G Broadcast as PWS Improvement, e.g. Delivery of Warning Messages from MME to eNodeB;
* Deployment Guidelines on concurrent support of 5G Broadcast and 5G Unicast;
* Support for 3GPP Service URLs;
* Deployment receiver profiles including a RAN-only profile;
* Low-latency distribution;
* Potential support of other improvements identified in the timeline of the work item.

### Updates towards ETSI TS 103 720 v1.2.1
5G-MAG completed in 2023 the 3GPP Release 17 updates for ETSI TS 103 720 v1.2.1.
The additions, discussed and agreed among members (see [**Kanban - ETSI TS 103 720**](https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/projects/32), included:
* Bug fixes, clarifications and upgrade to 3GPP Rel-17 specification
* Adding receiver requirements for consistent network planning including requirements on demodulation performance
* Adding bandwidth information, including 6/7/8 MHz, and broadcast UHF spectrum (based on 3GPP RAN work items)
* Support of 5GMS over eMBMS with reference to 3GPP TS 26.501 including hybrid use cases
* Codecs and Formats with reference to 5GMS in 3GPP TS 26.511
* Support for public warning and emergency alerts based on cell broadcast services.

### Publication of ETSI TS 103 720 v1.1.1
5G-MAG undertook in 2021 the maintenance of ETSI TS 103 720. The initial version (v1.1.1) of this document addressed:
* Support of Free-to-Air (FTA) and Receive-Only Mode (ROM) services.
* Network dedicated to linear TV/radio, using supplemental downlink channels and spectrum.
* Single Frequency Network (SFN) deployments with distances larger than cellular sites
* Support for mobility scenarios (e.g. up to 250 km/h) for cars, with external antennas.
* Support for common streaming distribution formats such as Dynamic Streaming over HTTP (DASH), Common Media Application Format (CMAF) and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
* Support for IP-based services such as IPTV or ABR multicast.
* Support for different file delivery services such as scheduled delivery or file carousels.
