## XCHANGE 10/10/2024
###	Resolution of issues found in 3GPP technical specifications
5G-MAG has been collecting feedback on 3GPP specifications since our last XCHANGE with 3GPP SA4. The issues raised by developers are in [GitHub: Kanban · Specifications - 3GPP - Feedback (github.com)](https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/projects/33/views/1).

-	Issues #148 and #149 are raised in the context of the feasibility analysis and usage guidelines for the deployment of Uplink 5G Media Steaming (5GMSu) and RTC architectures (as mentioned above) and as described by the Discussion Paper S4aI240135.

#### Issues previously adopted and targeting approval at SA#102 Edinburgh

Most issues are being dealt with (at low priority) in **TS 26.517 Rel-17 CR0001**.

- [#53](/5G-MAG/Standards/issues/53) Applicability of Schedule Description metadata unit in MBS User Service Announcement is inconsistent
  - Proposed clarification included in Qualcomm **TS 26.517 Rel-17 CR0001r11** in [S4aI230117](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_SA/WG4_CODEC/3GPP_SA4_AHOC_MTGs/SA4_MBS/Docs/S4aI230117.zip).

### New issues targeting approval at SA#101 Bangalore

- [#65](/5G-MAG/Standards/issues/65) TS26.512 MetricsReportingConfiguration scheme cardinality does not match YAML definition
  - Apparent discrepancy to be confirmed by SA4 experts.
  - See **TS 26.512 Rel-17 CR0037** in [S4aI230105](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_SA/WG4_CODEC/3GPP_SA4_AHOC_MTGs/SA4_MBS/Docs/S4aI230105.zip).
- [#67](/5G-MAG/Standards/issues/67) TS26.512 - Typo in word "Metrics" - Should be named "metrics".
  - See **TS 26.512 Rel-17 CR0037** in [S4aI230105](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_SA/WG4_CODEC/3GPP_SA4_AHOC_MTGs/SA4_MBS/Docs/S4aI230105.zip) table 11.2.3.1-1, but this really needs fixing in Rel-17 too.

  - Historical precedent for QoE metrics reporting in TS 26.247 annex F is random selection for load balancing.
- [#73](/5G-MAG/Standards/issues/73) TS26.512 - Consumption reporting: How is `aspId` for POST URL generated?
  - See **TS 26.512 Rel-17 CR0037** in [S4aI230105](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_SA/WG4_CODEC/3GPP_SA4_AHOC_MTGs/SA4_MBS/Docs/S4aI230105.zip) proposing change to API in Rel-18 to use `provisioningSessionId` instead of `aspId`.

- [#78](/5G-MAG/Standards/issues/78) 5GMSd - QoE Metrics Reporting - Clarification on sampling rate for buffer level
  - Proposed general solution applicable to _all_ QoE metrics (not just buffer level) is to add `samplingPeriod` to M1 `MetricsReportingConfiguration` and M5 `ServiceAccessInformation.clientMetricsReportingConfiguration`.
  - This would align TS 26.512 Rel-17 with Charles Lo's final **TS 26.532 Rel-17 CR0003**.
  - Should this change also be made to TS 26.512 Rel-16?
- [#75](/5G-MAG/Standards/issues/75) TS 26.512: Network Assistance recommendation and boost time windows

  - Apparent discrepancy, but original intent needs to be confirmed by SA4 experts.
- [#80](/5G-MAG/Standards/issues/80) 5GMS AF treatment of Network Assistance Session resource
  - How should 5GMS AF behave if a QoS is requested when creating a Network Assistance Session, but no Policy Template is cited?
  - And how should it behave if both of these are included when creating a Network Assistance Session?

## XCHANGE 11/03/2023

### What 5G-MAG does

* Provide **insight into specs** towards development/implementation (https://www.5g-mag.com/tech-xchanges)
* Foster **industry engagement** into applications and services (https://www.5g-mag.com/target2023)
* Support **development** and **implementation** work (https://developer.5g-mag.com)
* Bring specs to life with **demos** and **trials** (https://www.5g-mag.com/tutorials)
* Provide **specification feedback** to 3GPP (https://www.5g-mag.com/standards - https://github.com/5G-MAG/Standards/projects/2)

### 5G-MAG Reference Tools: achievements so far

Contributions: https://www.5g-mag.com/repositories

* Implemented a **Minimum Viable Product** for **5G Media Streaming** based on **downlink Content Hosting**.
  * Recently expanded this to include **5GMS AF provisioning** at reference point M1d and **5GMS AS configuration** at M3d.
* Basic Rel-17 reference implementations of the **5GMSd Application Function** and **5GMSd Application Server** that support the key features of **Content Hosting for downlink media streaming**.
  * Provisioning Sessions, Server Certificates and Content Hosting Configurations can be provisioned in the 5GMSd AF via an implementation of the M1d Provisioning API, complemented by a test client.
  * Server Certificates and Content Hosting Configurations can be configured by the 5GMSd AF in the 5GMSd AS via a simple prototype implementation of an M3d Configuration API, complemented by a test client.
* There are also basic reference implementations of the **Media Player** and **Media Session Handler** for Android.
  * The Media Session Handler, which runs as a shared Android background service, is driven by a basic implementation of the M6 Media Session Handling client API. It can retrieve its configuration for a specific Provisioning Session from the 5GMSd AF using the M5d Service Access Information API.
  Single index.json file that only contains provisioningSessionIDs, mediaPlayerEntry and M5 URL

#### Client-side workflow
1. Once the app starts, the mediaPlayerEntries are populated to the selection dropdown
2. An entry in the dropdown is selected
3. The MediaStreamHandler sends an IPC message to the Media Session Handler Background Service updating the lookup table (mapping between provisioningSessionIDs and mediaPlayerEntries)
4. A stream is selected and the mediaPlayerEntry is send via IPC to the MediaSessionHandler
5. The Media Session Handler Background Service contacts the AF (or a mocked REST server) using the route syntax defined in 26.512 11.2.2: {apiRoot}/3gpp-m5/{apiVersion}/service-access-information/ adding the {provisioningSessionId}. provisioningSessionId derived via lookup table.
6. Once it has received the Service Access Information it sends back an IPC message to the Media Stream Handler with the mediaPlayerEntry
7. The Media Stream Handler plays the MPD defined in mediaPlayerEntry using M7 interface and Exoplayer.
8. Media Stream Handler collects metrics. Metric reporting endpoint to be defined.

### What we intend to do next
* Continue engaging with standards experts in driving specs beyond the writing work.
* Help SA4 spec development based on developers’ feedback. Our GitHub tracker is open to anyone: https://github.com/5G-MAG/Standards/projects/2
  * 5G-MAG and SA4 MBS subworking group have held two joint meetings already (in the run up to SA4#121 Toulouse and SA4#122) and these concentrated on maintenance of TS 26.512 Rel-16 and Rel-17.
  * The changes to that specification agreed recently in Athens are due to go to SA#99 next week for approval and publication, and we have already started to implement them at risk.
  * For the forthcoming meeting cycle, there is a mixture of issues relating to:
    * **TS 26.512**, based on the reference implementation experience.
    * **TS 26.517**, primarily notifying gaps that have been identified.
  * 5G-MAG is aware that both SA4#123-e and SA4#124 Berlin feed into SA#100 Taipei, so the next opportunity to see agreed changes after Easter will be in late June.
* 5G-MAG intends to participate in the upcoming **3GPP Rel-19 Workshops** in our role as Market Representation Partner of 3GPP. We would like to understand the plans for SA4 on such workshops (schedule, thoughts, …)
