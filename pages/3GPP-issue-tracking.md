Note that:
-	The content of TS 26.512 Rel-17 CR0080 [S4aI240116] (issue #146) was agreed in the SA4 MBS ad hoc meeting preceding SA4#130.
-	Stage-2 fixes for issue #141 were agreed at the SA4#129e meeting and approved for publication at SA#105; for stage-3, TS 26.512 Rel-18 CR0081 is to be looked at by the present SA4 MBS meeting.
-	Issues #148 and #149 are raised in the context of the feasibility analysis and usage guidelines for the deployment of Uplink 5G Media Steaming (5GMSu) and RTC architectures (as mentioned above) and as described by the Discussion Paper S4aI240135.
